FreePascal IRC Library

This is a very incomplete, very lame IRC library for FreePascal. It uses some Windows specific stuff, is hardcoded,
and is generally rubbish.

I couldn't find an IRC library at all on the internet, so I had to resort to cooking up one of my own.

Someday this will probably be a complete implementation, but until then, the basics are there and will help you get started, at least.

Good luck!
