FreePascal IRC Library

This is a very incomplete, very lame IRC library for FreePascal. It uses some Windows Specific stuff and is hardcoded
and is generally rubbish.

I couldn't find an IRC library at all on the internet, so I had to resort to cooking up one of my own.

Someday this will probably be done, but until then, the basics are there and will help you get started, at least.

Good luck!
